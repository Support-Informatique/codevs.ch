## üîÑ Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We follow the best practices for CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

### Linting Check

Every push to the `main` branch triggers a linting check using the `npm run lint` command. This helps in maintaining a clean, error-free codebase.

### Automatic Deployment

Any push to the `prod` branch triggers an automatic deployment to our live site. Before the deployment, we also run a `npm run lint` command to ensure that the production version is error-free and ready for deployment.
